01  WS-AREA-1 PIC X(100). 01  WS-AREA-2 REDEFINES WS-AREA-1.      05  WS-SUB-AREA-1 PIC 9(5).      05  WS-SUB-AREA-2 PIC X(95).    * In this example, WS-AREA-1 is defined as a PIC X(100) field, which means it can hold 100 alphanumeric characters.    * Then, WS-AREA-2 is defined as a redefinition of WS-AREA-1 using REDEFINES.    * WS-AREA-2 further breaks down the same memory space into two sub-fields: WS-SUB-AREA-1 and WS-SUB-AREA-2.   * In this situation, if the programmer mistakenly writes data to WS-AREA-1 without considering its redefinition (WS-AREA-2), data truncation, or other unexpected behavior may occur.  * The programmer also may not be aware that the data changes affecting WS-AREA-1 will immediately change the data in WS-AREA-2 and vice versa.
